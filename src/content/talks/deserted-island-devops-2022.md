Team knowledge, configurations, and infrastructure access can be challenging in
a distributed world. Have you ever asked “what’s that command we use?” or “Where
are the secrets to access that environment?” - well this talk is for you!

In this talk, I explore using Oh-My-Zsh, a powerful Zsh configuration framework,
in order to share team knowledge, distribute common configurations, and share
infrastructure access. I also discuss the real world scenario this use case
emerged from, challenges faced in this approach, and how you can leverage
Oh-My-Zsh for your distributed devops teams.
