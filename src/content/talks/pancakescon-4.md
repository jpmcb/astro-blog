PancakesCon is a community cybersecurity and hacking conference put on by Stack Overflow.
Alongside a technical topic, presenters are encouraged to present on something _not_
tech related.

In this talk, I explore what container escapes are, how to harden against them in
your production workflows using tools like Bottlerocket, SE Linux, and defensive security practices.
I also discuss the history of funk bass (along with some samples!)
