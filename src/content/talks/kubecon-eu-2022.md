For years, I've maintained Cobra; a Go command line bootstrapping
library and core dependency for many CNCF projects, including Kubernetes, Helm,
Etcd, Istio, Linkerd, and many more.

In this talk, I discuss the challenges of being a
solo maintainer on such an important project, the lottery factor, the need for
contributor community, and the secure software supply chain implications this
all has for the entire CNCF ecosystem.
